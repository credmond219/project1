    "Description: \n",
    "Project Team 7 has undertaken the initiative \"Feeling Lucky!\" Our team is committed to helping society understand how to use lottery trend analysis information to improve their lottery picks. Our team will analyze data sets from several U.S. lottery sources to identify commonalities. Project Team 7 is particularly interested in identifying the following: \n",
    "1.\tThe frequency with which specific winning numbers occur\n",
    "2.\tNumbers groups that result in winning strings \n",
    "3.\tAre you feeling lucky? Pick a number!!\n",
    "The project team believes its research will provide a resource to improve its chances of living the American dream, a leisure lifestyle sipping lattes, and checking our lottery portfolio.\n"
